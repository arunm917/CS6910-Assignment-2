# CS6910-Assignment-2

The second assignment was on using CNNs for classifying images in the given subset of iNaturalist dataset. In part A of the assignment a 5 layered CNN was built and trained trained from scratch. This network was then used to classify images in the iNaturalist dataset. In part B of the assignment a pre-trained model viz. Resnet50 was used for the same task. The objective of the second part of the assignment was to demonstrate the concept of transfer learnign whereby complex models trained on large volume of data are fine tuned to perform specific tasks. The fine-tuned model was able to provide double the accuracy on the test set, thereby demonstrating the power of transfer learning.

1. The colab files 'cs6910_assignment_2.ipynb' and 'cs6910_assignment_2_PartB.ipynb' were used for developing the program
2. 'cs6910_assignment_2.ipynb' contains code for Part A of the assignment
3. 'cs6910_assignment_2_PartB.ipynb' contains code for Part B of the assignment
4. Once the priliminary version of code was made, the codes were transferred to the python files 'cs6910_assignment_2_PartA.py' and 'cs6910_assignment_2_PartB.py' for training purpose
